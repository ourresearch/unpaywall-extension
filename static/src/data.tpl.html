        <p>
            Unpaywall is powered by a database of 100 million scholarly papers. Of these, about 16 million have links to fulltext open access, making it the largest open database of
            <a href="faq#legal">legal</a>
            Open Access (by summer of 2018, we'll have around 18 million). It's also the most accurate: all records are keyed by DOI, and precision (98%) and recall (75%) of OA detection lead the industry (see
            <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/4375/">our PeerJ paper</a> for more on these numbers). We harvest OA content from over
            <a href="sources">50,000 unique sources</a> including open repositories, OA journals, Hybrid journals, and services like DOAJ and Crossref.

        <p>There are lots of ways you can use the Unpaywall dataset in your own projects, depending on what you're trying to do:</p>

                <strong>Librarians:</strong>
                can integrate Unpaywall into their

                or

                link resolvers, so library users can read OA copies in cases where there's no subscription access. Over 1000 libraries worldwide are now using this now.

                <strong>Institutional Repository managers</strong>
                can use Unpaywall data to find OA resources that faculty have posted online, without depositing in their IR. These can be automatically ingested, significantly increasing IR coverage without needing to convince faculty to deposit. Repositories of all sizes have used Unpaywall data in this way.  SwePub (national repository of Sweden) added 75,000 new OA records, increasing number of OA records by over 30%, while the smaller
                <a href="https://ir.library.carleton.ca/">the Carleton University IR</a> added 1000 OA records, doubling their fulltext coverage. There are a few good ways to access our data for this use case:
                <a href="dataset">downloading the complete dataset,</a>
                <a href="check-dois">check lists of records by DOI,</a> or
                taking advantage of Unpaywall's integration into the
                <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?and_facet_open_access=True">Dimensions</a> and
                <a href="https://clarivate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Clarivate-OA-Impact-Story_Intro-sheet.pdf?elqTrackId=c5abee7048934a3da317e296a3e2a9c8&elqaid=5350&elqat=2">Web of Science.</a>

                <strong>OA researchers</strong> can use Unpaywall to answer research questions about the current and historical state of open access. There are several ways to access the data for research: you can use the
                <a href="api">open API,</a>
                <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roadoi/vignettes/intro.html">or the R API wrapper,</a>
                <a href="check-dois">check a list of DOIs,</a>
                or
                <a href="dataset">download the complete dataset.</a> A particularly easy way to get started with research is to use <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?and_facet_open_access=True">Dimensions</a> or
                <a href="https://clarivate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Clarivate-OA-Impact-Story_Intro-sheet.pdf?elqTrackId=c5abee7048934a3da317e296a3e2a9c8&elqaid=5350&elqat=2">Web of Science, </a> which both have Unpaywall data integrated into their databases. That's the approach used by
                <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3520/">this recent paper.</a> You might also check out the
                <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/4375/">the canonical reference paper</a> for the dataset, which gives a good overview of the data as a whole.

                <strong>Enterprise users</strong> should check out our <a href="sla">SLA</a> in order to download and use the Unpaywall
                <a href="dataset">dataset</a> for commercial projects. Once you've done that, we can help you set up a mirror database that allows you to keep an always-current version of Unpaywall's data hosted on your own servers. You can also use the
                <a href="api">API</a> for any use (commercial or otherwise) for free.
