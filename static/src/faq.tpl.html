                <dd>
                    Overall, Unpaywall users find fulltext for 47% of articles. You may get different results,
                    depending on the age and topic of the articles you're reading. There's more information
                    on how we found these numbers in
                    <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/4375/">this paper.</a>

                    This success rate will improve as we tweak our algorithm and as
                    mandatory open access requirements take effect in the

                <dd>
                    We harvest content directly from
                    <a href="sources">
                        over 50,000 journals open-access repositories

                    from all over the world.

                    We also use great open data from

                <dt id="legal"><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>Is Unpaywall legal?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Yes! We harvest content from <strong>legal</strong> sources including repositories run by universities, governments, and scholarly societies, as well as open content hosted by publishers themselves. We do <em>not</em> harvest from sources of dubious legality like
                    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-017-2291-4">ResearchGate</a>

                <dd>
                    Since we index over 50,000 sources of OA content, there's a pretty good chance your repository is already in our database. You can make sure by
                    <a href="sources">searching our sources list.</a>

                <dt id="privacy-policy"><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>What's your privacy policy?</dt>
                <dd>
                    The extension doesn't store or ask for any personal information from you, so when you use Unpaywall
                    we don't know who you are. The extension doesn't track your browsing history, and it
                    doesn't send any content from any page you visit to our servers, with one exception:
                    when a page has a DOI (a short identifier used by scholarly articles), we send that DOI
                    to our server (using an encrypted HTTPS connection) to find any free versions.
                    We will log requests to our servers
                    (which include the DOI and the IP address the request came from) in order to
                    monitor and improve service. But those logs aren't
                    connected to your identity. Furthermore, the extension won't send or use
                    any kind of browser fingerprinting technology to identify your computer.

                <dd>Indeed we can. Click the green Unpaywall extension icon in
                    your browser toolbar and choose "Settings." Once there, tick "Color-code tab for Green and Gold OA."

                <dt id="oadoi"><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>How is this related to the oaDOI service?</dt>
                <dd>
                    We used to call the browser extension "Unpaywall," and the data source behind it "oaDOI." That got confusing, so now the whole project is just called Unpaywall, including the database, the API, the extension, and everything else. The services previously offered under the oaDOI name still work (and are still handling millions of daily users), but the name itself has been retired.

                </dd>

                <dt id="different-results-from-unpaywall">Why does the Unpaywall extension sometimes give different results from the API or dataset?</dt>
                <dd>
                    The extension occasionally reports "open" when the API doesn't because the extension, in addition to checking our API, also checks the source code of publisher pages themselves as you visit them.
