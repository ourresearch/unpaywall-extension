                    right now), you'll see an "unlock" tab on the right of your browser.

                    Millions of researchers are currently uploading their own fulltext PDFs

                    way to find them as we browsed. So we made one! Eventually, we hope tools like
                    Unpaywall will nurture the transition to fully

                    About half the time. For example, in

                <dd>
                    Like Unpaywall, Sci-Hub finds fulltext PDFs for paywalled articles. The main difference
                    is where those PDFs come from: Unpaywall finds PDFs legally uploaded
                    by the authors themselves, while
                    Sci-Hub uses PDFs that are obtained by other means, including automated web scraping
                    of publisher sites. Sci-Hub's method delivers more comprehensive results,
                    but is not super legal. So while
                    <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/comparing-sci-hub-oadoi/">we're not against Sci-Hub,</a>
                    we think Unpaywall offers a more sustainable approach by working within copyright law
                    and supporting the growing open access movement.

                <dd>
                    The <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/">OA Button</a> and Unpaywall are similar. But the
                    OA Button is a more mature project
                    (it's been working since 2013) with great features Unpaywall lacks.
                    The OA Button works on
                    articles without DOIs, and it helps you email a request for fulltext to the author if
                    none is available. It'll also help you find open datasets.
                    Unpaywall is more of a one-trick pony. The great thing is, both are open-source
                    and free, so you can install both, or

                    We gather content from thousands of open-access repositories worldwide.
                    To help us, we rely on some fantastic open data services, especially
                    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a>,
                    <a href="https://doaj.org/">the DOAJ,</a>

                <dd>
                    The extension doesn't store or ask for any personal information from you, so when you use Unpaywall
                    we don't know who you are. The extension doesn't track your browsing history, and it
                    doesn't send any content from any page you visit to our servers, with one exception:
                    when a page has a DOI (a short identifier used by scholarly articles), we send that DOI
                    to our server (using an encrypted HTTPS connection) to find any free versions.
                    We will log requests to our servers
                    (which include the DOI and the IP address the request came from) in order to
                    monitor and improve service. But those logs aren't
                    connected to your identity. Furthermore, the extension won't send or use
                    any kind of browser fingerprinting technology to identify your computer.

                    Sorry about that! Unfortunately this is pretty common, especially where publishers
                    don't follow standard practices for article display (as they often do not).
                    For instance, we don't work for articles missing
                    <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/what-is-doi.aspx">DOIs.</a>

                    The good news is that it's still early days for this project and
                    it's under very active development. When you find an error,
